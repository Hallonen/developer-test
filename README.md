#Task
This test has been built to include as many legacy and bad coding practises that we could think of.
Here is a short list of things that are wrong with the code in developer-test.php

* Missing code comments and DocBlocks
* HTML validation errors
* Wrong indentation
* Bad naming for variable, class and method
* Incorrect use of static and public
* Deprecated function uses
* Does not work with PHP7
* Some hidden surprises
* Spelling mistakes
* Incorrect characters
* Incorrect placement of tags
* Fatal PHP errors
* Inconsistency in code implementations

**Task:** Fix as many of the wrongs as possible and make the code readable.
